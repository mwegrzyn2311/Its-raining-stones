English name: "It's raining stones!"
Goal: Reach the Exit after collecting as much points as possible.
Controls:
	- Arrow keys to move the player
	- WASD to eat edible objects that are next to the player
	- R to reset the current level
	- You can only move at or eat edible objects
There are various objects in the game, each having different behaviour:
    a) Objects that don't care about gravity
	- Unbreakable wall - Usually surrounds the whole level, cannot be destroyed in any way
	- Breakable wall - The one made with bricks, can be exploded, but cannot be eaten
	- Empty cell - Well, it is just empty. What did you even expect?
	- Grass - Can be eaten, can be exploded. No, you don't get extra points for eating it!
	- Player - Well, it's basically you! You can move him, eat grass, but when something hits you or you get caught in an explosion, you explode and the level is restarted after a short delay. Not edible, we are not for cannibalism :v
	- Tunnels - They can be used to travel in one-way if the destinated side is not blocked by unedible object. Cannot be eaten or exploded. If a few tunnels appear next to each other, and they are turned in the same direction, you will travel all way long to what is on the other side of that whole chain of tunnels.
	- Explosion - Outcome of an explosion (its visual represantation). If you get caught in one, you explode as well.
	- Exit - When you reach it, you can finish the level with as many points, as you have already acquired. Not edible, can be exploded. There can be more than one exit on the map! 
    b) Objects that actually care about gravity
	- Rock - One day, it will fall at you, and it will kill you. Not edible, but it can be exploded.
	- Game point - Like finally, right? Well, it is usally not difficult to collect some of them. But, you gotta catch 'em ALL to impress me!
	- Disc - Well, basically a bomb, but to heavy for you, to keep it in a pocket. When it will be able to, it will start falling down, and eventually explode after falling. It something falls on it or it gets caught in an explosion, it also explodes. Of course, you cannot eat it!
For some levels, you should read the "Clues and tips" txt file in order not to be stuck in there not knowing how to pass it.
Game is inspired by the original "Supaplex" game, however, some mechanics are different and I designed original levels for it.
